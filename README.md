## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Telemedicine Dataset**: Explored trends, seasonal patterns, and key metrics.
- **Healthcare Dataset**: Analyzed patient satisfaction ratings and other relevant metrics.

### Data Cleaning

- **Telemedicine Dataset**: Handled missing values and outliers, standardized the data.
- **Healthcare Dataset**: Cleaned data, corrected inconsistencies, and formatted for analysis.

### Predictive Modeling

- **Random Forest Regressor**: 
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 0.152
  - **R-squared**: 0.994

### Benchmarking and Correlation

- **Benchmark Results**:
  - Average Patient Survey Star Rating (Healthcare): 3.12
  - Average Value (Telemedicine): 22.11

- **Correlation**:
  - Correlation between datasets: -0.94 (indicating a strong inverse relationship).

### Regional Analysis

- **Benchmarking**: Compared average values across different states.
- **Visualization**: Plotted regional differences and trends.

## Conclusion

This project has successfully analyzed and compared telemedicine and healthcare data. By applying advanced data analysis techniques and predictive modeling, we identified key trends and insights. The benchmarking and correlation analysis provided a comprehensive view of how telemedicine adoption and healthcare ratings relate to each other. The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting telemedicine trends. This analysis offers valuable insights for stakeholders in both telemedicine and healthcare sectors.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced Predictive Modeling**: Explore additional machine learning models to improve predictions.
- **Further Analysis**: Conduct deeper dives into regional variations and time-based trends.
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate stakeholder feedback to refine analysis and recommendations.
